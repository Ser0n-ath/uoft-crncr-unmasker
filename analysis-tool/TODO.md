Todo (maybe)
1. scrape all program pages.
2. time machine archive csv upload -> mass crawl to same
3. download from archive instead.
4. static preprocessing (text extraction from html) followed by a local llm to extract program / details (open/close)
5. insertion to db
6. make course to open program mapping list.
